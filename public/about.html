<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Muthukumar, a final-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student at PSNACET with a growing passion for web development. I'm currently building my skills in front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and expanding into full-stack development. I enjoy creating user-friendly, responsive websites and am eager to explore frameworks and tools that enhance the web experience.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I’m a professional ball badminton player, having competed at zone, inter-zone, and state levels. This experience has taught me discipline, focus, and the value of teamwork—qualities I bring into my coding journey as well.</p>

<p>I’ve also worked on tech projects like an Arduino-based Child Safety System, which introduced me to real-world problem-solving and automation. I'm a quick learner, self-motivated, and always up for a challenge—whether it's debugging code or learning a new framework.</p>

<p>My short-term goal is to land a web development role in a reputed company, and my long-term aim is to grow into a senior developer position, constantly upgrading my skills and contributing to impactful projects.</p>
